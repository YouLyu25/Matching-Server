These test cases are used for functionality testing.
The .xml files are used to simulate the XML requests and will be
read and sent by the testing program.

The test cases incoporate various of possible operations which may
be sent by the clients.

To run the test cases, first use "sudo docker-compose up" to start
the server and then, on a different machine, use:
./client testX.xml
to send the request and wait for the results.

Note that the "X" in "textX" indicates the current number of test
cases. Also, if the server is run in a different machine, the hard-
coded server address in client.cpp has to be changed to the current
server address and the program has to be re-made.

The expected/testing results are shown in result.xml
