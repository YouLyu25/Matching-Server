The port for connection is set to "12345"

to run the docker, use: "sudo docker-compose up"

if something wrong happends during docker up, please try: "sudo docker-compose build" first
or if the first time client cannot connect to the docker, try start it again using
"sudo docker-compose up"

also, if there are changes in the code and the user want to re-make, he/she needs to
change current directory to ./exchange_server, and then do "make" which will generate binary
file "server", then he/she would be able to run "sudo docker-compose up"

Also, the run of this program depends on the boost library. If no boost library is included
in this directory and the user accidentally removed the binary "server", he/she may have to
use "wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.66.0/source/boost_1_66_0.tar.bz2"
then "tar --bzip2 -xf boost_1_66_0.tar.bz2" and
enter directory "boost_1_66_0"
then "./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=all --with-toolset=gcc"
then "./b2 toolset=gcc"
then "./b2 install --prefix=/usr"
finally "sudo ldconfig"
and then re-make the program, then use sudo docker-compose up to steart the docker.
